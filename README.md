# XIMG-EMBL project

This package is the part of the project on Research and Development of X-ray tomography at the P14 EMBL beamline at PETRA-III (DESY). This package is dedicated to:
- [Flatfield-correction](https://github.com/maximka48/XIMG-EMBL/blob/master/examples_public/demo_SSIM_1d-PR.ipynb)
- [Single-distance Phase retrieval (Paganin, Bronniokv, CTF algorithms)](https://github.com/maximka48/XIMG-EMBL/blob/master/examples_public/demo_SSIM_1d-PR.ipynb)
- Phase retrieval with multi-distance CTF-based approach
- Parallel-beam X-ray tomography

I try to update the examples timely so the user could get an idea of usage. However, you may also find useful to check each function or class have a situational description.
Feel free to contact me should you have any questions [Maxim Polikarpov](polikarpov.maxim@mail.ru)
